# Item 3 - Aquaphor

## Aquaphor can be used to heal and soothe dry skin and helps protect from damage. It's used as chapstick most of the time which is what I mainly use it for as well. 

## I make sure I have an aquaphor with me everywhere I go because my lips get dry and chapped very easily. I've been on Accutane for a decent amount of time and dry skin and lips is one of the main side affects so I make sure to rehydrate then as often as possible.
