# Item 2 - Hair Clip

## My hair clip of choice is always a claw clip. It's easy to just throw your hair up quick and take on the go.

## Most of the time, I clip one of them to my bag for wherever I'm going. If I'm going to class I'll clip it on a strap of my bag and use it to put my hair up if I need to. I change my mind about my hair a lot so I like to have options for what to do with it.
