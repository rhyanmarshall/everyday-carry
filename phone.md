# Item 1 - My Phone

## I have an iPhone 16 pro that comes with me everywhere. It does many important things for me on a daily basis, like connect with people, take pictures, play music, organize my life, etc. 

## When I leave the house I use my phone to play music in the car, then I usually use it to check the time wherever I am. I obviously use it for GPS very often, to text and call people, view my calender, and take pictures. It's important for emergency situations but is also used for pleasure and enjoyment!
